    <div class="about-info2">
Born and raised in Ventura, with a passion for caputuring moments to insprie others. As a child,
I loved running around with my moms camera snapping photos of every flower and bug I could find in our
backyard. As I got older and I grew to love capturing landscapes as the sunrised or my family playing at the 
park. For me, each photo represented a story of a moment in my life. Looking back at those photos I feel so much
joy and happiness. I knew I wanted to share this feeling with the world. That's when I decided to open KC Phototgraphy.
My portfolio showcases some favorite images from the past few years; I strive to create photographs that not only capture a moment,
but also capture a feeling and essence.<br><br>

I am available for private portrait sessions, as well as events in the Ventura
and Santa Barbara areas -- though I would also be very interested in working 
on location elsewhere. <br><br>

I'd love to hear from you, so feel free to contact me.<br><br>

Thank you for taking time to look at my site and work; I hope to meet you in the near future.
